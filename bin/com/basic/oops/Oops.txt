Rules for creating Java constructor

Types of Constructor

	1. No-Arg (Without) Constructor
	A Java constructor may or may not have any parameters (arguments).


	2. Parameterized Constructor :-
	A Java constructor can also accept one or more parameters. Such constructors are known as parameterized constructors .


	3. Default Constructor:-
	If we do not create any constructor, the Java compiler automatically create a no-arg constructor during the execution of the program.





Java Constructor	Java Method
A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.	A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
A constructor must not have a return type.	A method must have a return type.
The constructor is invoked implicitly.	The method is invoked explicitly.
The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class.	The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
The constructor name must be same as the class name.	The method name may or may not be same as the class name.
